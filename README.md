# RTL-Design-and-Synthesis-
# Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis
## 1- Introduction to open-source simulator iverilog
### (i) SKY130RTL D1SK1 L1 Introduction to iverilog design test bench
#### What is simulator?
In RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, a simulator is a specialized software tool used to verify the functional correctness of digital hardware described in an HDL (Hardware Description Language) such as Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL before the design is synthesized or implemented on hardware
In this workshop we'll use iVerilog

#### What is test bench?
A test bench in RTL design is a special HDL (Hardware Description Language) module created to verify and validate the functionality of another module, known as the Device Under Test (DUT). The test bench applies a set of input signals (stimulus) to the DUT and checks whether the outputs produced by the DUT match the expected results, according to the design specification.
A test bench in RTL design is like a virtual testing environment for your digital circuit. Think of it as a small program, written in the same language as your design (like Verilog or VHDL), that helps you check if your circuit works correctly.
Here’s how it works in simple terms:
The test bench sends inputs (like test signals or data) to your circuit, which is called the Device Under Test (DUT).
It then watches the outputs that come out of your circuit to see if they are correct.
The test bench itself is not part of the final hardware—it’s just for testing in simulation, not for building into a chip.
